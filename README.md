# **copy-paste-url**

Like its name suggests - copy and paste links into mpv with `ctrl + v` to start playback of a video. This needs an open mpv window like `mpv --idle --force-window` or a window already playing a video. Also the script utilizes *powershell* (for windows) or *xclip* (for linux), so that needs to be installed as well.

## Disclaimer

this is a *fork* of `https://github.com/zenyd/mpv-scripts.git` that a add support for **LINUX**.
